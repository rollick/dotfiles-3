dotfiles
===============
These are my dotfiles.

Requirements
---------------
zsh >= 5.0.5

Installation
---------------
My dotfiles are optimized to be installed with
[GNU stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

Simply run `stow -t ~/ <application>` from inside the git repository.

For further information on handling your configuration with GNU stow see the [official manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/).
